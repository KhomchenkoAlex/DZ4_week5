IO and ZIP

The user enters a path to a directory and the program zips up the directory items into several zip files. The program should zip up files of the given directory and all the subdirectories.
The program supports such file types:
audio (mp3, wav, wma);
video (avi, mp4, flv);
image (jpeg, jpg, gif, png).
As the result you must have 3 archives: audios.zip, videos.zip and images.zip. 
You can use File, FileFilter, (G)ZIPOutputStream or something else.
